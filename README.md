This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms as part of an assignment on Data Structures and Algorithms. The assignment covers the implementation and testing of a hash table MyHashTable and a binary search tree BST, along with additional functionalities such as custom hashCode() methods and in-order traversal for iterators.

Contents
MyHashTable: Implementation of a hash table (MyHashTable) with methods for insertion, retrieval, removal, and other operations.
MyTestingClass: A custom class used for testing the hash table, with a custom hashCode() method.
BST: Implementation of a binary search tree (BST) with methods for insertion, retrieval, deletion, and in-order traversal.

Also, The MyHashTable class utilizes chaining for collision resolution.
Custom hashCode() methods are implemented for the MyTestingClass to ensure a balanced distribution of hash codes.
The BST class supports in-order traversal for iterators, allowing elements to be iterated over in sorted order.
